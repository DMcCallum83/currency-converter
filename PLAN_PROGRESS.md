## Progress Log

**[2024-12-19]** Project plan and progress log created.

**[2024-12-19]** **Project Structure & API Layer Setup Complete**

- Created directory structure following the plan:
  - `src/api/` - API functions and TypeScript types
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `src/pages/` - Page components
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for currencybeacon.com API responses
- Created API functions for fetching currencies and conversions with proper error handling
- Built custom hooks using React Query for data fetching and caching:
  - `useCurrencies` - Fetches and caches currency list (1 hour stale time)
  - `useConvertCurrency` - Handles currency conversions (5 minute stale time)
- Set up React Query provider in main.tsx with sensible defaults
- Created .env file for API key configuration
- **Technical Decisions Made:**
  - Used React Query for data fetching to handle caching, loading states, and error handling
  - Implemented proper TypeScript types for API responses to ensure type safety
  - Set different stale times for currencies (1 hour) vs conversions (5 minutes) based on data volatility
  - Used environment variables for API key management
  - Implemented proper error handling in API functions

**[2024-12-19]** **UI Components & Styling Complete**

- Built all core components with TypeScript and accessibility features:
  - `CurrencySelector` - Dropdown with currency flags, codes, and names
  - `AmountInput` - Numeric input with validation and formatting
  - `ConversionResult` - Displays conversion results with loading/error states
  - `Home` - Main page that integrates all components
- Implemented comprehensive styling with:
  - Modern, clean design with proper spacing and typography
  - Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
  - Accessible color contrast and focus states
  - Loading and error state styling
- Added interactive features:
  - Currency swap button between from/to currencies
  - Real-time conversion as user types
  - Proper form validation and error handling
- **Technical Decisions Made:**
  - Used BEM methodology for CSS class naming
  - Implemented proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
  - Added responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Used semantic HTML structure
  - Implemented proper error boundaries and loading states
  - Added currency formatting using Intl.NumberFormat
  - Used proper TypeScript interfaces for all component props

**[2024-12-19]** **SCSS Conversion Complete**

- Converted from CSS to SCSS for better maintainability and organization
- Added SCSS features:
  - Variables for colors, spacing, and breakpoints
  - Mixins for reusable styles (focus, disabled, button, input)
  - Proper nesting for better organization
  - Better responsive design with variable breakpoints
- **Technical Decisions Made:**
  - Used Vite's built-in SCSS support (no additional packages needed)
  - Organized variables at the top for easy theming
  - Created reusable mixins for common patterns
  - Maintained BEM methodology with SCSS nesting
  - Used SCSS variables for consistent spacing and colors

**[2024-12-19]** **Testing Environment Setup Complete**

- Set up comprehensive testing environment with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Created test configuration files:
  - `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration with jsdom environment
  - `src/test-setup.ts` - Test setup with jest-dom matchers
- Added test scripts to package.json:
  - `npm test` - Run tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:run` - Run tests once
  - `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI (if available)
- Wrote comprehensive component tests:
  - `CurrencySelector.test.tsx` - Tests for currency dropdown functionality
  - `AmountInput.test.tsx` - Tests for numeric input validation and formatting
  - `ConversionResult.test.tsx` - Tests for conversion display and states
- **Technical Decisions Made:**
  - Used Vitest for fast, modern testing with TypeScript support
  - Used React Testing Library for component testing with user-centric approach
  - Added jest-dom for additional DOM matchers
  - Used jsdom for browser environment simulation
  - Focused on testing user interactions and accessibility features
  - Tested loading states, error handling, and edge cases
